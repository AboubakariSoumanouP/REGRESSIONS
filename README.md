  In this REGRESSIONS project, data set from the Machine Learning Repository at the University of California, (Irvine) was selected and analyzed by: 
	- Performing a simple linear regression analysis by constructing the scatterplot of the response against the predictor, reporting and interpreting the values of MSE and R^2
	- Performing a multiple linear regression analysis by producing an Anova table, performing the F test, computing the Extra Sum of Square and the coefficient of partial determination
	built the “best” regression model using all potential predictor variables (with no interaction terms)
